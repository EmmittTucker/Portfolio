# Emmitt J Tucker's Coding Portfolio
Last updated: 3/20/2025
## About Me
My name is Emmitt J Tucker. Currently I am a master's student enrolled in Northeastern's MS Align program as part of the Fall 2024 cohort. Prior to enrolling at Northeastern, I completed my B.S. in Biology from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 2018 before working in the Biotech industry for 5 years. I was also attempted to start my own gaming company named Absurd-i-Oh that would attempt to make citizen science more popular. Throughout my time in Biotech, I focused heavily on lab automation through both lab robotics and automation coding. I have a wide variety of topics I am interested ranging from Human-AI collaboration to evolutionary computation. I plan to pursue a PhD program upon completion of my M.S. degree. 
<br><br>
Outside of programming I enjoy gaming and movie culture (particularly horror movies). My interest in gaming in particular has greatly influenced my personal projects as I assume you will see through my projects.
